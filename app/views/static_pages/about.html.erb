                <hr>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; font-size: 1.2em;">OnCampusChef is a service that is dedicated to providing college students affordable, healthy, and downright delicious meals for the week by connecting you to students who are passionate and love cooking!</p>
                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; font-size: 1.2em;">Once you create an account, you can browse through our curated list of customizable meal plans and order your three favorite meals for that week. Once we receive your order and complete the transaction, we deliver the groceries straight to your doorstep and send you your own personal student chef who will meet you at a scheduled time. During the allotted time, your chef will bulk cook ten meals, and portion them into gladware that we provide so that you can eat at your convenience throughout the week.</p>

                <p style="font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial; font-size: 1.2em;">The length of the chef appointment is dependent on the number of students ordering in the group. In addition, we have a separate time schedule for students who use our budget plan. Once you have scheduled your chef appointment and grocery delivery, which is done via our website, our chef will come to your apartment or home and cook your meals during the allotted time.</p>
