			 WeCook is an affordable lifestyle choice. Our service is suitable for regular use so that anyone can eat healthy, delicious, homemade meals on a daily basis made by <b>your very own Personal Chef</b>.  No more grocery shopping, cooking and cleaning.

		     Our service is designed to prepare and present to you a minimum of 8 meals in one Chef appointment. The more meals you order, the less the price per meal. In a typical week, you may need only one Chef appointment to get all your main meals for lunch and dinner.

			 Imagine taking healthy and delicious meals for your lunch or packing one for your children when they go to school. The busy schedules of working professionals may not allow regular home cooking but now through our service, you can do so without having to spend the time. No more excuses ;-)
